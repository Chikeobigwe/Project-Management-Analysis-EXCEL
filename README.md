# Project Management Analysis using Excel

## Project Overview

This project showcases my Excel expertise in data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I worked with a project management dataset containing attributes such as task ID, task owner, task start and end dates, delivering company, task status, and project phases. The goal was to analyze project performance, team efficiency, and task distribution.

## Data Extraction & Cleaning

- Extracted data from a SQL Server database using **macros** and **VBS scripts**.
- Performed **data cleaning** to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.

## Domain Research & Analysis Approach

Before conducting the analysis, I researched **project management in the tech industry** to understand key concepts. I then structured my analysis as follows:

1. **Identified key variables** relevant to project performance and task efficiency.
2. **Categorized the data** to assess distribution and detect bottlenecks.
3. **Analyzed team performance** to uncover trends in task completion and efficiency.

## Key Insights & Visualizations

I utilized **pivot tables** for quick comparisons and created **charts** to derive meaningful insights. The findings were grouped into three key areas:

### **A. Task Status and Project State**

1. Distribution of companies delivering tasks.
2. Project tasks and their status distribution.
3. Overall task status breakdown.
4. Current state of ongoing projects.

### **B. Project Workloads and Efficiency**

1. **Project Workloads:** Total number of tasks for each project.
2. **Project Efficiency:** Average number of tasks completed per project.

### **C. Task Owners and Completion Trends**

1. Task completion distribution across different owners.
2. Workload distribution by task owner.
3. Task status trends over time based on start dates.

## Dashboard & Interactivity

I designed an **interactive dashboard** in Excel, incorporating **slicers** for:

- Projects
- Task Owners
- Task Status
- Companies Delivering Tasks

## Key Data Attributes

| Attribute                | Description                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `ProjectTaskProjectCode` | Project identifier             |
| `TaskOwnerEmail`         | Task owner details             |
| `ProjectTaskMIS1`        | Project phase                  |
| `ProjectTaskMIS2`        | Sub-phase of the project       |
| `ProjectTaskMIS5`        | Company delivering the project |
| `ProjectTaskMIS4`        | Current state of the project   |

## Tools & Technologies

- **Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Macros, VBA, Dashboards)**
- **SQL Server (Data Extraction & Transformation)**
- **VBS (Data Automation)**

## Business Impact

- Provided insights into **project efficiency, task distribution, and team performance**.
- Identified workload distribution across **companies, projects, and task owners**.
- Helped stakeholders **optimize project management strategies** by focusing on efficiency and bottlenecks.
